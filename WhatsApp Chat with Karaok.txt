17/03/2024, 10:23 - Rain 🌧️🦋: yoooo pog
17/03/2024, 10:24 - Jazzy🕸️: It'll be a group effort it's okay!! If people just bring whatever they can it saves one person from spending copious amounts on food :) I don't mind doing the meat/meat alternatives for the veggies since that'll be the priciest part most likely
17/03/2024, 10:24 - Rain 🌧️🦋: like we have an entire beef joint just chilling in our freezer-
17/03/2024, 10:24 - Rain 🌧️🦋: yooo

17/03/2024, 10:43 - Jazzy🕸️: Okay!!
17/03/2024, 10:43 - Jazzy🕸️: If we do a roast type thing we would need

06/05/2024, 18:17 - +44 7501 730937: so I think late afternoon/early evening is best so people can get ready before hand then we can all get back after the picnic drop everything off in our rooms and then go to karaoke
06/05/2024, 18:17 - Kai: i wanna have just cider bc its summer drinks but man ill get nowhere on just cider

14/05/2024, 12:23 - Kai: i think its a pass???? its not great tho
14/05/2024, 12:24 - Naomi: A pass is still good!!!!
14/05/2024, 12:24 - Kai: 19/40 💀
14/05/2024, 12:24 - +44 7444 198256: that’s still good!!
14/05/2024, 12:25 - Zak ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／: What's that for?
14/05/2024, 12:25 - Kai: chem assessment 2
14/05/2024, 12:25 - Zak ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／: Shit I didn't check that....
14/05/2024, 12:26 - Kai: i got 52/80 for assessment 1 so its over 40% overall i think
14/05/2024, 12:26 - Kai: and iirc 40% is the pass mark
14/05/2024, 12:27 - +44 7444 198256: yeah i think you’ve definitely passed which is great
14/05/2024, 12:27 - Kai: idk abt bio or project yet tho
14/05/2024, 12:29 - Zak ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／: I got 49 out of 80 on the first assessment and 9 out of 40 for the second assessment
14/05/2024, 12:29 - Zak ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／: See the good thing though with the zoology course is it doesn't really matter massively if you pass chemistry
14/05/2024, 12:29 - +44 7444 198256: you’ve both done amazing :)
14/05/2024, 12:30 - Zak ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／: Because from what my personal tutor said it's biology that you want to pass - chem doesn't really matter massively
14/05/2024, 12:31 - Zak ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／: Weirdly though it looks like I've done better on biology than chemistry although it was the complete opposite in secondary school in college
14/05/2024, 12:32 - Kai: i think i need a fair amount of chem for water quality and similar stuff in marine bio
14/05/2024, 12:33 - Zak ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／: Also I don't think project is being released for a while yet which is annoying
14/05/2024, 12:34 - Kai: i thought theyd release the bio marks for the last test before we took the one on friday

26/05/2024, 18:19 - Jazzy🕸️: It wasn't intentional!! I think the last time it was brought up we genuinely were on the fence about it, I dont think it's come up properly since we confirmed we were going

26/05/2024, 18:27 - +44 7362 483028: Also, I understand this but to be blunt this isn't the first time y'all have left me out of stuff :')

It only takes one text or message, and I wasn't the only person left out here, it's tiring being mad about things but I'm just upset by this point tbh

This isn't directed at just you btw, this is something that's been happening for a while with this group of people where even external people have pointed it out to me!

I still want to be friends, and I genuinely hope y'all had a good time, I just think it was a bit of a dick move by people icl
26/05/2024, 18:44 - +44 7362 483028: But yeah, no, I hope people have a good day, I'm going to leave the chats for a bit.
